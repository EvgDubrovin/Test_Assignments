# Test Task - Company_1

There is the postgres database. Access: **********************************

Table ***users*** — users info  
Table ***transactions*** — these users' payments info.

There are 3 questions from different departments. I have to answer each of them in a free form and attach the used sql queries.

**Question 1, traffic department**  
We want to target advertising by gender and age to purchase traffic as efficiently and profitably as possible. Which user segment should we target to?

**Question 2, marketing department**  
We want to run a 5-level loyalty program. The level is given depending on the amount of money spent by the user. What level thresholds to make and why?

**Question 3, traffic department**  
We pay to the advertising network for each user who made a payment. How much can we afford to pay for each engaged user, if the payback should be no longer than 1 month?
